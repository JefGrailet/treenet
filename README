About TreeNET - By Jean-François Grailet, April 30, 2015
========================================================

Overview of the program
=======================

TreeNET is a subnet-based topology discovery software which is built upon the 
subnet inference software ExploreNET. Not only TreeNET provides refinement 
techniques for subnets inferred by ExploreNET, but it also builds a structure 
(which we will refer to as "network tree") which is used to locate subnets 
with respect to each other. The intuition is that close subnets (e.g. which 
can reach each other with a TTL of at most 1) forms a neighborhood, inside 
which lies a mesh of routers (and Ethernet switches). The network tree aims 
at hightlighting these neighborhoods, on the basis of the inferred subnets and 
the traceroutes to each of them. With this network tree, TreeNET is also able 
to perform alias resolution to discover one or several routers. The final, 
fully annotated tree can be interpreted as a whole topology.

TreeNET is currently only available for Linux.

About TreeNET and TreeNET Reader
================================

TreeNET actually comes in two pieces of software: TreeNET "Full", which 
provides TreeNET as a measurement/topology discovery tool, and TreeNET 
"Reader" which is meant to parse files outputted by TreeNET "Full" to analyze 
them and merge them.

In particular, TreeNET Reader comes with the traceroute/alias resolution tools 
present in TreeNET "Full" such that it can re-compute the routes and alias 
resolution hints for the subnets it parsed (usually from several files).

Indeed, a network tree is relevant only if it uses traceroutes computed from a 
same vantage point. As TreeNET needs to be deployed on several machines to 
infer subnets within a large network, TreeNET Reader allows one to re-compute 
all traceroutes and alias resolution hints from the same vantage point for all 
measurements (when provided together).

TreeNET Reader is also able to convert a fully built/annotated network tree 
into a bipartite graph for further analysis (with other softwares).

Content of this folder
======================

As the names suggest, Full/ contains all sources for TreeNET as a measurement 
tool (simply named "TreeNET") while /Reader provides all the sources of 
TreeNET Reader. Both folders come with their own README files, detailing 
compilation and usage.

The third and last sub-folder, Measurements/, contains measurements of four 
autonomous systems (or ASes) which were computed between March 23th and April 
24th. You can learn more about them by reading the README file at the root of 
this folder.

TreeNET and TreeNET Reader were both written by Jean-François Grailet during 
the academic year 2014-2015 in the context of a master thesis at the 
University of Liège (Belgium).

TreeNET and TreeNET Reader use parts of ExploreNET (basic components for both 
and subnet inference tools for the former), a subnet inference tool conceived 
and implemented by Mehmet Engin Tozal, currently assistant teacher at the 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette (USA).

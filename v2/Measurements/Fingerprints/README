About Fingerprints/ folder - By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet, May 9, 2016
==================================================================

Overview
========

This folder contains a bunch of figures used for the analysis of the list of 
fingerprints collected for alias resolution on several ASes involved in our 
measurements with TreeNET. Figures are classed by dates, and each figure 
highlights a different aspect of the fingerprints for the 20 ASes which are 
involved in them.

ASes
====

For convenience, the ASes are denoted by an index in the figures. The assigned 
indexes are given below.

Figures
=======

For each date, we provide 4 different figures illustrating the observed 
properties of fingerprints collected on the 20 ASes listed above.

* IPIDClass_[year]_[date].pdf: shows stacked bar charts to show the proportion 
  each IP-ID counter "class" among the fingerprints. There are 3 different 
  classes:
  -Echo: the fingerprinted IP just echoes the IP-ID found in the probe packet 
   in its reply, 
  -Healthy: the fingerprinted IP provided a different IP-ID than the one which 
   was in the probe packet, and the sequence of IDs collected for that IP 
   could be used to evaluate a speed at which IDs increase, 
  -Random: same as Healthy, except a speed could not be obtained because the 
   sequence is not sound.
  There is also a 4th class represented in the graph: "Others", denoting the 
  fingerprints for which no class could be derived.

* ITTL_[year]_[date].pdf: shows stacked bar charts, just like above, but this 
  time illustrates the inferred initial TTL of the echo reply from the probed 
  IP, if responsive. There are 3 typical values: 64, 128 and 255.

* TSRequest_[year]_[date].pdf: shows the proportion of fingerprinted IPs which
  replied (or not) to ICMP timestamp requests.

* SSR_[year]_[date].pdf: shows the proportion of fingerprinted IPs versus the 
  total of responsive IPs detected by TreeNET. A blue curve also shows the 
  size of the largest list of fingerprints (~= largest Neighborhood) with 
  respect to the total amount of responsive IPs. The purpose of this figure is 
  to show the benefits of the space search reduction produced by TreeNET, 
  which is a consequence of the subnet inference and network tree structure.

We also provide a 5th figure "AliasProportions_[year]_[date].pdf" which shows 
for each date and for all 20 ASes the proportion of fingerprinted IPs which 
were aliased vs. the proportion of IPs which were not aliased to any other IP 
at all. The goal of this figure is to show that we successfully obtain a large 
amount of aliases in most cases, despite a few pathological cases where this 
proportion is rather low. This can be explained by the supposed lack of 
precision of the subnet inference or the classical issues of traceroute which 
affect TreeNET's space search reduction.

Scripts/ sub-folder
===================

All figures were obtained through Python scripts. Interested readers can view 
these scripts in this folder. Note that the scripts should be edited to take 
account of user's filesystem, and that they all need some input file to have 
a list of the concerned ASes. Examples of such files are provided.

Also note that the output files of the scripts are not exactly identical to 
the names of the provided figures.

About Measurements/ folder - By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet, December 2, 2015
=======================================================================

Overview
========

This folder contains measurements which were conducted on PlanetLab testbed 
with TreeNET. Each sub-folder is named after an AS and contains measurements 
for that particular AS, with a sub-folder per data set denoted by the date at 
which the measurements for this data set were started.

At the root of each AS sub-folder, you should find a "[AS number].txt" file, 
which contains the IP prefixes of this AS which are fed to TreeNET as the 
target prefixes.

Data sets
=========

Each data set consists of 3 files:
-A subnet dump (.subnet), where subnets are listed with the following syntax:
 
 [CIDR Notation]\n
 [Classification]\n
 [Responsive interfaces, as IP - TTL separated with ,]\n
 [Traceroute, as IPs separated with ,]\n
 [Blank line]\n

-A dump of the IP dictionnary (.ip) that lists all responsive IPs with their 
 respective minimum TTL value to reach them from the vantage point and alias 
 resolution hints (when available). The syntax is:
 
 IP - Minimum TTL: [Alias resolution hints]\n
 
 if this IP has alias resolution hints, otherwise it simply is
 
 IP - Minimum TTL\n

-A larger text file (Analysis.txt) giving the analysis of the network tree 
 built by TreeNET along the inferred routers and dependencies (or linkage) 
 between Neighborhoods. This file always starts with a dump of the tree 
 itself, which the syntax is:
 
 Depth - Type of node: Label(s) or Subnet\n
 
 Lines corresponding to internal nodes also contains the "(Previous: ...)" 
 mention, which gives the label of the parent node which appears in all 
 traceroutes of all children subnets appearing in the current branch. It is 
 used to disambiguate multi-label nodes. For example, if the parent node 
 bears two labels but the child internal node has a single IP in the 
 "previous" mention, then it is certain that the other label belongs to a 
 router which does not provide access to the Neighborhood of the child 
 internal.

Sometimes, data sets might also come with a fourth and last file containing 
the string "xnet++" in the name. It simply is another subnet dump obtained 
with ExploreNET++ for the same AS, obtained for comparison purpose (i.e., 
assessing the refinement techniques added by TreeNET). The syntax is identical 
to the regular subnet dump, except it does not have the traceroute line.

Terminology
===========

To better understand the data sets and the .txt file, here are some 
definitions.

* ACCURATE subnet: a subnet which, having N responsive interfaces, features 
  exactly N - 1 interfaces located at the same TTL (Pivot interface) while the 
  last one is located at that same TTL minus 1 (Contra-Pivot interface). From 
  a topological point of view, the Contra-Pivot interface is the interface of 
  the last router crossed before reaching the subnet that belongs to that 
  subnet.

* ODD subnet: a subnet which features outliers preventing it from being 
  classified as ACCURATE. An ODD subnet is not necessarily the result of a bad 
  measurement, and can be the result of particularities in the target network 
  architecture.

* SHADOW subnet: a subnet for which no Contra-Pivot could be found.

* Alias Resolution Hint: a notation consisting of:
  
  token;ip-id,delay,token;ip-id,delay...token;ip-id,DNS
  
  The amount of token;ip-id pairs (= N) can be chosen by the user, but it is 
  typically 4 in most data sets. There are N - 1 delays between each pair, 
  separated with a comma. The last comma delimits the last pair from the DNS 
  of this IP, if it exists.
  
  The tokens are used to know in which order the ip-ids were retrieved. The 
  delays express, in microseconds, the time that passed between the retrieval 
  of each token;ip-id pair for a given IP. All these pieces of information are 
  used to perform alias resolution by Ally or by studying the velocity of the 
  IP-ID counter of this IP.

* Credible subnet: a subnet which is either ACCURATE, either ODD with more 
  than 70% of its interfaces being valid Pivot and less than 10% of its 
  interfaces being Contra-Pivot candidate.

* Neighborhood: a location bordered by subnets which can reach each other with 
  at most one hop. By extension, it is an internal node in the network tree 
  produced by TreeNET.

* Hedera: the nickname given to (internal) multi-label nodes. "Hedera" is the 
  Latin root of the French word "lierre", which denotes a kind of ivy. Ivies 
  typically tying distinct branches together, it is a nice analogy for 
  multi-label nodes which actually consist of several Neighborhoods "tied" 
  together into a single internal node.

* Complete linkage: denotes the fact that a neighborhood either has only 
  leaves (i.e. subnets) as children, either has a subnet for each label of its 
  children internal nodes (i.e. each subnet contains the label).
  
* Partial linkage: a relaxed definition of "Complete linkage". Either the 
  neighborhood has complete linkage, either there lacks a single subnet for a 
  single child internal.

About Measurements/ folder - By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet, April 27, 2016
=====================================================================

Overview
========

This folder contains measurements which were conducted on PlanetLab testbed 
with TreeNET, with the exception of one folder dedicated to files related to 
the assessement of the alias resolution techniques used by TreeNET and a 
second folder containing Python scripts for data analysis. See the own README 
of these folders for more details.

Each sub-folder is named after an AS and contains measurements for that 
particular AS, with a sub-folder per dataset denoted by the date at which the 
measurements for this dataset were started.

At the root of each AS sub-folder, you should find a "[AS number].txt" file, 
which contains the IP prefixes of this AS which are fed to TreeNET as the 
target prefixes.

Composition of the datasets
===========================

Each dataset consists of up to 7 files, with a minimum of 3:

-A subnet dump (.subnet), where subnets are listed with the following syntax:
 
 [CIDR Notation]\n
 [Classification]\n
 [Responsive interfaces, as IP - TTL separated with ,]\n
 [Traceroute, as IPs separated with ,]\n
 [Blank line]\n

-A dump of the IP dictionnary (.ip) that lists all responsive IPs with their 
 respective minimum TTL value to reach them from the vantage point and alias 
 resolution hints (when available). The syntax is:
 
 IP - Minimum TTL: [Alias resolution hints]\n
 
 if this IP has alias resolution hints, otherwise it simply is
 
 IP - Minimum TTL\n

-(2015 only) A larger text file (Analysis.txt) giving the analysis of the 
 network tree built by TreeNET along the inferred routers and dependencies 
 (or linkage) between Neighborhoods. This file always starts with a dump of 
 the tree itself, which the syntax is:
 
 Depth - Type of node: Label(s) or Subnet\n
 
 Lines corresponding to internal nodes also contains the "(Previous: ...)" 
 mention, which gives the label of the parent node which appears in all 
 traceroutes of all children subnets appearing in the current branch. It is 
 used to disambiguate multi-label nodes. For example, if the parent node 
 bears two labels but the child internal node has a single IP in the 
 "previous" mention, then it is certain that the other label belongs to a 
 router which does not provide access to the Neighborhood of the child 
 internal.

-(From 2016 onwards) A "Bipartite ..." file containing a double bipartite 
 representation of the measured AS (one bipartite being router - subnet, the 
 other being switch (L2) - router), based on its representation as a network 
 tree (not given, but can be obtained using TreeNET Reader). The bipartite 
 file can be roughly split into 4 parts: the first lists the routers (and 
 their labels), the second lists subnets (and their labels), the third 
 provides links between routers of a same neighborhood with an imaginary 
 switch and the last gives the links between routers and subnets, using their 
 respective labels.

-(From 2016 onwards) A "Statistics" file giving some statistics on the subnets 
 and the Neighborhoods observed in the network tree obtained for this AS. 
 Those can be re-obtained and analyzed in depth using TreeNET Reader.

-(From 12/03/2016 onwards) an .alias file which contains alias lists (one per 
 line) as inferred by TreeNET v2.2.

-(From 12/03/2016 onwards) a .fingerprint file which contains the IP 
 fingerprints TreeNET computed for each IP. The main purpose of this file is 
 to evaluate the overall behaviour of router interfaces in a given AS, and to 
 evaluate if some alias resolution techniques are (still) relevant or 
 outdated. See TreeNET main README file to learn more about its 
 fingerprinting method. Note that the fingerprints might change from one 
 dataset to another due to extensions/refinements brought by the different 
 versions TreeNET used at the time (for example, v2.3 brings 2 new parts to 
 the usual fingerprints).

-(From 23/04/2016 onwards) a last file named "VP.txt" which gives the 
 PlanetLab node from which TreeNET was run to get the corresponding dataset.

Sometimes, early datasets might also come with a last file containing the 
string "xnet++" in the name. It simply is another subnet dump obtained with 
ExploreNET++ for the same AS, obtained for comparison purpose (i.e., assessing 
the refinement techniques added by TreeNET). The syntax is identical to the 
regular subnet dump, except it does not have the traceroute line.

Terminology used in the datasets
================================

To better understand the datasets and the provided statistics, here are some 
definitions.

* ACCURATE subnet: a subnet which, having N responsive interfaces, features 
  exactly N - 1 interfaces located at the same TTL (Pivot interface) while the 
  last one is located at that same TTL minus 1 (Contra-Pivot interface). From 
  a topological point of view, the Contra-Pivot interface is the interface of 
  the last router crossed before reaching the subnet that belongs to that 
  subnet.

* ODD subnet: a subnet which features outliers preventing it from being 
  classified as ACCURATE. An ODD subnet is not necessarily the result of a bad 
  measurement, and can be the result of particularities in the target network 
  architecture.

* SHADOW subnet: a subnet for which no Contra-Pivot could be found.

* Alias Resolution Hint: a notation consisting of:
  
  token;ip-id,delay,token;ip-id,delay...token;ip-id,DNS
  
  The amount of token;ip-id pairs (= N) can be chosen by the user, but it is 
  typically 4 in most datasets. There are N - 1 delays between each pair, 
  separated with a comma. The last comma delimits the last pair from the DNS 
  of this IP, if it exists.
  
  The tokens are used to know in which order the ip-ids were retrieved. The 
  delays express, in microseconds, the time that passed between the retrieval 
  of each token;ip-id pair for a given IP. All these pieces of information are 
  used to perform alias resolution by Ally or by studying the velocity of the 
  IP-ID counter of this IP.

* Credible subnet: a subnet which is either ACCURATE, either ODD with more 
  than 70% of its interfaces being valid Pivot and less than 10% of its 
  interfaces being Contra-Pivot candidate.

* Neighborhood: a location bordered by subnets which can reach each other with 
  at most one hop. By extension, it is an internal node in the network tree 
  produced by TreeNET.

* Hedera: the nickname given to (internal) multi-label nodes. "Hedera" is the 
  Latin root of the French word "lierre", which denotes a kind of ivy. Ivies 
  typically tying distinct branches together, it is a nice analogy for 
  multi-label nodes which actually consist of several Neighborhoods "tied" 
  together into a single internal node.

* Complete linkage: denotes the fact that a neighborhood either has only 
  leaves (i.e. subnets) as children, either has a subnet for each label of its 
  children internal nodes (i.e. each subnet contains the label).
  
* Partial linkage: a relaxed definition of "Complete linkage". Either the 
  neighborhood has complete linkage, either there lacks a single subnet for a 
  single child internal.

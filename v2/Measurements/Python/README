About Python/ folder - By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet, December 10, 2015
==================================================================

Overview
========

This folder contains a bunch of Python scripts which can be used to parse and 
analyze data sets produced by TreeNET v2.0 and its derivatives along some 
input files.

Content
=======

* Comparison.py: a script for comparing subnet dumps obtained by TreeNET v2.0 
  and ExploreNET++, respectively. It outputs in console the proportion of each 
  class of subnet along the covered IPs and the proportion of subnets which 
  are redundant in the subnet dump from ExploreNET++ and the proportion of 
  subnets from the same dump which are strictly smaller than overlapping 
  subnet found in the subnet dump of TreeNET.

* EvaluateCapacity.py: a script to evaluate the amount of IPs of a target 
  network, represented as a text file with IPv4 ranges or single IPs separated 
  by line breaks (see, for example, Measurements/AS224/AS224.txt).

* PlotResults.py: receives a .plot file (see Measurements/Alias resolution/) 
  to produce a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) and a Probablity Density 
  Function (PDF) graphs in the PDF format to visualize the results of an 
  alias resolution assessment conducted with TreeNET "ARTest".

* QuickAnalysis.py: receives a subnet dump from TreeNET and outputs in console 
  the amount of covered IPs along the proportion of ACCURATE, ODD and SHADOW 
  subnets.

* Simplify.py: receives a subnet dump (from TreeNET as well as ExploreNET++) 
  as input to produce a simplified version of it, where only the subnet CIDR 
  notation and the classification are kept and written on the same line rather 
  than separate lines. Not only this produces a smaller file, but it is also 
  meant to ease checking by network administrators.

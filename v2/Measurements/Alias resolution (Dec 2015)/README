About Alias resolution/ folder - By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet, December 10, 2015
============================================================================

Overview
========

This folder contains output files from ARTest, the alias resolution assessment 
version of TreeNET, along the input which was used to produce them. These 
files were used to evaluate the accuracy of the alias resolution techniques 
implemented in TreeNET v2.0 in November 2015 (precisely, the 19th of the same 
month).

Content
=======

* alias_lists.txt: the data set which was used as input. It was made available 
  by iPlane, and consists in a list of aliases, with an alias per line, which 
  could be inferred through IP-ID based techniques. It should be noted that 
  such a data set is refreshed once in a while, and therefore it was necessary 
  to provide the data set we used in case the data set currently available at 
  
  http://iplane.cs.washington.edu/data/alias_lists.txt
  
  was different from what we used.

* Assessment: the actual assessment output file. Each line is made of the 
  following components:
  
  (1) [IMPOSSIBLE|FAIL|SUCCESS AT X%]: overall result for this alias; 
      IMPOSSIBLE means no IP from this alias was responsive at the time of 
      measurement, FAIL means there were responsive IPs but TreeNET was unable 
      to associate any of them, and finally, SUCCESS AT X% means that IPs 
      could be associated. The percentage is the ratio between the amount of 
      interfaces of the largest inferred router and the amount of responsive 
      IPs for this alias.
  (2) List of IPs: the alias as it was provided in alias_lists.txt, except 
      that any unresponsive IP is followed by the mention "[X]".
  (3) List of inferred routers: in case the line starts with SUCCESS AT X% 
      with a X smaller than 100, this part lists the inferred routers as:
   
      [IP_1 (method), IP_2 (method), ...]
   
      The two methods are "Speed" (for velocity range overlap method) and 
      "Ally" (the name of the method). Two consecutive routers are separated 
      with a comma.
  
  The formatting is the following:
  
  (1) - (2)[: (3)] ([] = optional)

* Assessment.ip: the IP dictionnary as obtained by ARTest at the end of the 
  execution. Its main interests is for future parsing to re-run alias 
  resolution without any probing but with different parameters (e.g. the 
  maximum rounding error while computing a velocity).

* Assessment.plot: a file listing the success ratios for each alias, sorted 
  in ascending order. Aliases labelled with IMPOSSIBLE are represented by the 
  value -1, every other value being comprised in [0,1]. As the name of the 
  file suggests, it is used for plotting graphs without having to parse the 
  file "Assessment".

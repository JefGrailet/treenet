About TreeNET v2.2 - By Jean-François Grailet, March 17, 2016
=============================================================

Overview of the improvements
============================

From TreeNET v2.0 onwards
-------------------------

* Network pre-scanning: a new algorithmic step, the network pre-scanning phase 
  was designed solely for improving overall performance. The idea is to probe 
  a few times every target IP to ensure their responsivity, such that only 
  responsive IPs are considered in subsequent steps. Indeed, the subnet 
  inference and refinement steps can be costly in terms of probes, and can 
  potentially probe several times unreponsive IPs. To avoid this, TreeNET now 
  builds an "IP dictionnary" containing only responsive IPs from the 
  pre-scanning phase. Only IPs belonging to the IP dictionnary are probed 
  again, therefore reducing the probing cost. It is worth noting that the 
  pre-scanning is actually done two times, the second opinion scan using a 
  bigger timeout value to maximize the amount of responsive interfaces. A 
  third but optional scan can also be used.

* Better structure: the introduction of the IP dictionnary also improves the 
  overall structure of both the code and the output. In particular, the alias 
  resolution hints are now stored in the IP dictionnary, which is outputted 
  as a separate file in addition to the subnet dump. This avoids repeating 
  several times the same hints in the subnet dump for IPs which appear 
  multiple times in the file, which was an issue of TreeNET v1.0.

* Improved traceroute phase: to mitigate as much as possible the occurrences 
  of 0.0.0.0 in the routes (which can be due to delays), the Paris traceroute 
  phase now handles the timeout value to reprobe intermediate routers which 
  are unresponsive at first.

* Route repairment phase: the insertion in the network tree now starts with 
  the subnets which the route is complete (i.e., no occurrence of 0.0.0.0). 
  Then, the incomplete routes of the remaining subnets are compared to what 
  is already stored in the tree to find the most similar route and replace 
  the occurrences of 0.0.0.0 with corresponding segments from the complete 
  route. This step prevents routes from having holes which correspond to 
  usually responsive routers which are affected by delays or which decided to 
  not respond to probes any longer. This is especially useful for the less 
  deep parts of the network tree, where routers are probed for nearly each 
  traceroute.
  
* Refactored alias resolution: previously preferring reverse DNS over a 
  simplistic IP ID-based method in its v1.0, TreeNET now uses reverse DNS only 
  as a last resort technique (when IP IDs cannot be obtained). In its v2.0, 
  TreeNET collects multiple IP IDs for each IP and computes a delay between 
  each consecutive IP ID (for a same IP) in microseconds. These values can 
  then be used to apply the method Ally (i.e., having x from IP_1, y from IP_2 
  and z from IP_1, obtained sequentially, IP_1 and IP_2 are associated if 
  x < y < z with z - x being small enough) or to apply a new method based on 
  the velocity of IP ID counters (which is similar to the method used by 
  RadarGun, an alias resolution tool).

* More options: TreeNET v2.0 also offers more option than its previous 
  iteration, such as delay value between two consecutive threads to create a 
  small delay between probes to mitigate potential congestion when targetting 
  IPs which are close to each other, or several parameters to calibrate the 
  IP ID-based alias resolution methods.

* Faster and more accurate: the combination of the network pre-scanning phase 
  and all improvements mentioned above makes TreeNET v2.0 not only more 
  accurate, but also much faster than v1.0. It is now able to entirely 
  analyze ASes potentially having one or several millions of IPs on its own in 
  a few hours to a few days (if there are not too many responsive IPs), while 
  the previous version required to be deployed on several machines and a 
  merging phase with TreeNET Reader to obtain the same delays.

From TreeNET v2.1 onwards
-------------------------

* Improved refinement phase: when TreeNET is unable to find a Contra-Pivot for 
  an incomplete subnet which has been expanded to the maximum (i.e., /20), it 
  now keeps the fully expanded subnet in a new subnet set to avoid unnecessary 
  probing tasks, which are, in this case:
  -expanding another incomplete subnet if the Pivot TTL in it is the same as 
   in the fully expanded (undefined) subnet and if the former is encompassed 
   in the latter.
  -inferring a subnet from a pivot IP if the TTL to reach it is the same as in 
   the fully expanded (undefined) subnet and if this subnet contains that IP.
  Avoiding both tasks allows TreeNET v2.1 to run faster when probing an AS 
  where a large amount of responsive IPs ultimately lead to SHADOW subnets 
  (i.e., without any Contra-Pivot interface), as it skips these time-consuming 
  cases once it observed one of them (for a given /20 IPv4 address block).

From TreeNET v2.2 onwards
-------------------------

* Alias resolution refinement: now able to detect when an IP replies to a 
  probe with the same IP ID as in the initial probe packet, and also able to 
  take a guess at the initial TTL of an ECHO reply packet, TreeNET now 
  performs IP fingerprinting during alias resolution. The fingerprint in v2.2 
  is made of three components:
  -the inferred initial TTL of an ECHO reply packet sent by this IP,
  -a classification for the behaviour of this IP when it comes to IP ID 
   (Echo, Random IP ID, "Healthy" counter that increases monotonically),
  -a "Yes/No" telling if a host name for this IP is known or not.
  After collecting alias resolution hints and fingerprinting each IP of a same 
  Neighborhood, TreeNET v2.2 groups IPs by fingerprint. When DNS is available 
  or when there are non-echoed IP IDs, TreeNET tries to chunk the groups into 
  several alias lists with reverse DNS association or the classical 
  IP ID-based techniques (such as Ally). Future versions of TreeNET might 
  expand the fingerprinting process by taking account of additionnal 
  characteristics of the ECHO replies, such as packet size.

* New output files: to provide as much data as possible when it comes to alias 
  resolution, TreeNET now also outputs an .alias and a .fingerprint dump files 
  which respectively provides the alias lists it got (one list per line, with 
  only the aliased IPs) and the fingerprints for each fingerprinted IP.

About ARTest
============

ARTest stands for "Alias Resolution Test". Just as its name suggests, this 
derived version of TreeNET exclusively implements the alias resolution part. 
It also features a completely different input/output: instead of IP prefixes 
or single IPs separated with \n, each line of the input should consist of a 
list of IPs (separated with a blank space) which are considered to belong to 
a router. In other words, the input file is more or less a ground truth ARTest 
is going to analyze.

Then, ARTest proceeds by analyzing each separate list to see if it can infer 
the same router with the alias resolution techniques of TreeNET based on 
IP IDs. If some IP proves to be unresponsive at the time of probing, it is 
not considered during the evaluation.

At the end, ARTest outputs the same lists of IPs, but commented, to highlight 
where TreeNET would be successful and were it would not. It also outputs the 
obtained IP dictionnary and a text file listing success rates of each list 
(already sorted in ascending order), separated with \n, for plotting purposes.

In January 2015, ARTest has been upgraded to its v1.1 to offer an offline 
mode. Now able to parse the IP dictionnary dumps it usually outputs, ARTest 
can perform alias resolution with new parameters on already existing data, 
avoiding any probing work. This offline mode eases parameter tuning.

About ExploreNET++
==================

Despite its name, ExploreNET++ is not actually an improvement of ExploreNET 
but rather a rehash providing an improved input/output scheme and fixing some 
minor issues (e.g. regarding memory usage). Among others, the subnets inferred 
by ExploreNET++ are outputted in the same fashion as TreeNET (minus the Paris 
Traceroute part) to ease comparison. The targets are also checked with 
multiple concurrent threads to speed up the overall execution.

However, in order to stay faithful to ExploreNET v2.1 for the core parts, 
ExploreNET++ does not include features of TreeNET such as network pre-scanning 
or subnet merging.

About Reader
============

Released in late January 2016, TreeNET Reader v2.0 takes into account all 
the improvements brought to TreeNET v2.1, such as the improved alias 
resolution, and is also able to parse both the subnet dump and IP dictionnary 
as outputted by TreeNET v2.1. It also now features two modes of re-computation 
(i.e., when merging several datasets together, routes and alias resolution 
hints should be re-computed for maximal accuracy): either only alias 
resolution hints are being re-collected, either both routes and hints are 
collected again.

The bipartite conversion, a major feature of TreeNET Reader v1.0, has also 
been improved to slightly decrease the amount of imaginary routers and to 
avoid the few duplicate links that occurred in bipartite graphs generated by 
the previous version.

In February 2016, TreeNET Reader has been upgraded to v2.1 to add dataset 
merging algorithms. See the README file in Reader/ for more details on this 
matter.

In March 2016, TreeNET Reader has been upgraded to v2.2 to get the new alias 
resolution additions brought to TreeNET (v2.2).

About Measurements/ folder - By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet, May 2, 2015
==================================================================

Overview
========

This folder contains measurements which were conducted on PlanetLab testbed 
with TreeNET and TreeNET Reader (the former for the actual measurements, the 
latter for merging them).

4 ASes are listed:
-AS224 (stub)
-AS5400 (transit)
-AS3209 (transit)
-AS7018 (Tier-1)

While the first two could be measured on a daily basis, the two last were 
measured a single time: AS3209 indeed had a large amount of responsive 
interfaces, while AS7018 is very large in terms of possible IPs (slightly more 
than 77 million IPs). Their measurements had to be conducted in several steps, 
renewed on a daily basis.

Content of each folder
======================

AS224/ and AS5400/ contains sub-folders each containing a single data set, one 
per day they were measured (i.e. every day between March 23th and April 24th).

AS3209/ and AS7018/ each contains no sub-folder, as there is only one data 
set. The measurements for AS3209 were started on April 13th, while those for 
AS7018 started on March 25th.

Each data set consists of 3 files:
-A measurements files (except for AS3209, which set was split in 3), where 
 subnets are listed with the following syntax:
 
 [CIDR Notation] 
 [Classification] 
 [Responsive interfaces, as IP - TTL [Alias Resolution Hint] separated with ,] 
 [Traceroute, as IP [Alias Resolution Hint] separated with ,] 
 [Blank line] 

-A small text file giving some statistics about the measures and the tree 
 produced by TreeNET (simply named "Statistics"). Sometimes, this file also 
 signals problems encountered with the measurements (e.g. when a PlanetLab 
 node crashed).

-A larger text file giving a bipartite representation, with first the 
 different routers and subnets involved in the graph, then 2 list of links: 
 one for imaginary switches reconnecting routers together (within a same 
 neighborhood) and one for connections between routers and subnets.

Terminology
===========

To better understand the data sets and their statistics, here are some 
definitions.

* ACCURATE subnet: a subnet which, having N responsive interfaces, features 
  exactly N - 1 interfaces located at the same TTL (Pivot interface) while the 
  last one is located at that same TTL minus 1 (Contra-Pivot interface). From 
  a topological point of view, the Contra-Pivot interface is the interface of 
  the last router crossed before reaching the subnet that belongs to that 
  subnet.

* ODD subnet: a subnet which features outliers preventing it from being 
  classified as ACCURATE. An ODD subnet is not necessarily the result of a bad 
  measurement, and can be the result of particularities in the target network 
  architecture.

* SHADOW subnet: a subnet for which no Contra-Pivot could be found.

* Alias Resolution Hint: a notation consisting of Token|IP Identifier|Reverse 
  DNS, or Token|IP Identifier or simply Reverse DNS. These "hints" are used to 
  infer routers by gathering interfaces which share similarities in these 
  hints.
  
  It should be noted that the token is a number used to chronologically class 
  the IP Identifiers to evaluate if the corresponding IPs are from a same 
  router (such alias resolution technique was inspired by Ally/Radar Gun).

* Credible subnet: a subnet which is either ACCURATE, either ODD with more 
  than 70% of its interfaces being valid Pivot and less than 10% of its 
  interfaces being Contra-Pivot candidate.

* Covered IPs: the sum of the total amount of possible IPs of each inferred 
  subnets.

* Neighborhood: a set of subnets which can reach each other with at most one 
  hop. By extension, it is an internal node in the network tree produced by 
  TreeNET.

* Complete linkage: denotes the fact that a neighborhood either has only 
  leaves (i.e. subnets) as children, either has a subnet for each label of its 
  children internal nodes (i.e. each subnet contains the label).
  
* Partial linkage: a relaxed definition of "Complete linkage". Either the 
  neighborhood has complete linkage, either there lacks a single subnet for a 
  single child internal.

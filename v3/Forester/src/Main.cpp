    cout << "if a measurement with Arborist crashed halfway, such that only subnets without\n";
    cout << "route were obtained.\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "Like its probing brother, TreeNET \"Forester\" consists in a sequence of precise\n";
    cout << "algorithmic steps which are however not always carried out, as some steps only\n"; 
    cout << "occur if the user provides several datasets and/or uses particular options\n";
    cout << "(see usage). The different algorithmic steps are described below.\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "Algorithmic steps\n";
    cout << "=================\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "0) Launch and parsing\n";
    cout << "---------------------\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "Forester parses options and flags (if any) and its main argument which should\n";
    cout << "list all the input files containing the data the user wants Forester to work\n";
    cout << "with. These input files shoud actually be seen more like prefixes of their\n";
    cout << "real names, as Forester will automatically append their names with the right\n";
    cout << "extensions (.subnet and .ip) to get all relevant parts of a given dataset for\n";
    cout << "the subsequent steps. If there are several datasets, they are parsed into\n";
    cout << "separate structures rather than a single one.\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "1) (If several datasets) Grafting mode\n";
    cout << "--------------------------------------\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "When several datasets are provided, Forester enters a special mode called\n";
    cout << "\"grafting mode\" where it proceeds to merge the .subnet files into a single,\n"; 
    cout << "unified file. The challenge of this step is to get accurate traceroute results\n";
    cout << "for each subnet in order to get a credible tree, which is made difficult by\n";
    cout << "the fact that each dataset probably comes from a different vantage point (or\n";
    cout << "VP). To obtain reasonable results, Forester isolates each datasets in\n";
    cout << "different trees and proceeds to select the best VP for grafting. This VP is\n";
    cout << "elected by computing, for each dataset, the percentage of subnets from other\n";
    cout << "datasets which have late labels (i.e., at the end of routes) in common with\n";
    cout << "the current dataset. Once selected, the routes in datasets from other VPs are\n";
    cout << "\"grafted\" using the common late labels.\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "The edited subnets are written in a new .subnet output file. Subnets which the\n";
    cout << "route could not be grafted are considered as \"scraps\" and written in a\n";
    cout << "separate file (also a .subnet one, prefixed with \"Scraps \"). Forester then\n";
    cout << "stops its execution, but can be relaunched to complete the new .subnet file\n";
    cout << "with corresponding .ip, .alias and .fingerprint output files.\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "This \"grafting\" process is currently Work In Progress, or rather, it has been \n";
    cout << "implemented but not yet validated. It also has the advantage of being entirely\n";
    cout << "passive.\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "2) (Optional) Neighborhood inference\n";
    cout << "------------------------------------\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "This step can be decomposed in two separate steps: traceroute and network tree\n";
    cout << "construction. In the former, Paris traceroute is ran towards a live IP of each\n";
    cout << "subnet to obtain a route for each inferred (and refined) subnet. This step\n";
    cout << "also uses multi-threading to speed up the process and multiple techniques\n";
    cout << "(both offline and online) to mitigate traceroute anomalies. A new .subnet\n";
    cout << "output file is then produced to provide the new routes. Next, the subnet and\n";
    cout << "route data is used to build the network tree that will locate subnets with\n";
    cout << "respect to each other and isolate neighborhoods. This part is entirely passive\n";
    cout << "(i.e., no probing). In addition to the new .subnet output file, this step also\n";
    cout << "produces a .tree output file which provides a text representation of the tree\n";
    cout << "structure.\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "In Forester, the traceroute part is optional as the provided input can already\n";
    cout << "have route data. The user can however request Forester to re-run this part of\n";
    cout << "TreeNET along alias resolution because of a previous emergency stop or major\n";
    cout << "networking issues. The traceroute also has some additionnal steps in Forester,\n";
    cout << "like re-evaluating distances in TTL and (contra-)pivot interfaces.\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "3) (Optional) Alias resolution\n";
    cout << "------------------------------\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "The inferred neighborhoods are used to isolate candidate IPs for alias\n";
    cout << "resolution, which are probed again to obtain alias resolution \"hints\" - data\n";
    cout << "used to fingerprint each candidate and later select the best alias resolution\n";
    cout << "method to use for a given set of alias candidates. It is only after this final\n";
    cout << "probing task that TreeNET carries out the actual alias resolution by analyzing\n";
    cout << "each neighborhood separately. At the end of this step, several output files\n";
    cout << "are produced:\n";
    cout << "-a .ip file, providing all responsive IPs (both from pre-scanning and others\n";
    cout << " appearing in routes),\n";
    cout << "-a .fingerprint file, listing all candidate IPs for alias resolution and their\n";
    cout << " respective fingerprint,\n";
    cout << "-an .alias file, which provides all the aliases that were obtained,\n";
    cout << "-a .neighborhoods file, which provides a detailed analysis of each\n";
    cout << " neighborhood as seen in the tree, along aliasing details.\n";
    cout << "The hint collection requires probing, but analysis is entirely passive.\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "Again, in Forester, re-doing alias resolution (either the actual alias\n";
    cout << "resolution alone, either both hint collection and actual alias resolution) is\n";
    cout << "not mandatory as the input data can already have everything. The user can\n";
    cout << "nevertheless request Forester to re-run (partially or totally) this step\n";
    cout << "to fix alias resolution hints or re-conduct the actual alias resolution with\n";
    cout << "different parameters.\n";

    cout << "./treenet_forester [input file prefix nÂ°1],[input file prefix nÂ°2],[...]\n";
    cout << "\n";
    cout << "Here, an \"input file prefix\" denotes the name of any file from a dataset\n";
